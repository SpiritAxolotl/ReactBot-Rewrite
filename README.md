# ReactBot Rewrite

A Tauri rewrite of JacksFilms's ReactBot, originally made in Unity

## Why?

This version is more performant (no lag even when resizing, less RAM usage) + it works natively on platforms other than Windows

# TODO

- Downloading the base video pack off of a CDN
- localhost POST endpoint for triggering a reaction via external programs (OBS)
